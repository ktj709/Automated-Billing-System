# Billing Frontend (Front-end/)

This folder contains a React/Vite frontend prototype.

Notes:
- The repo’s primary UI is Streamlit (`streamlit_app.py`).
- This frontend is optional and typically talks to an API surface (e.g., Flask `app.py`) if/when used.

## Run locally

Prereqs: Node.js 18+

```powershell
cd Front-end
npm install
npm run dev
```

For backend setup and environment variables, follow the repo root `README.md`.
